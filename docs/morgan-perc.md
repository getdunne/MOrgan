# MOrgan Perc - Percussion processor

**MOrgan Perc** (percussion) is an MIDI-effect plug-in, which takes MIDI input and produces output MIDI, but no audio output. Its purpose is to trigger any downstream instrument plug-in to produce notes in a manner reminiscent of the Hammond "percussion" circuit.
