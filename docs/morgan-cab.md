# MOrgan Cab - Leslie Cabinet simulator

**MOrgan Cab** (cabinet) is an audio-effect plug-in, which takes a stereo input signal and produces a stereo output signal. It neither accepts nor produces MIDI data.

This plug-in processes incoming audio using two different *rotary speaker* models, reminiscent of the type of ["Leslie" speaker cabinet system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_speaker) often used with Hammond organs.

- The first model adapts code from the [setBfree project](https://setbfree.org/) (see e.g. https://github.com/pantherb/setBfree), which was itself based on the paper "[Discrete Time Emulation of the Leslie Speaker](https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=15120)" by Jorge Herrera, Craig Hanson, and Jonathan S. Abel, Presented at the 127th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, 2009 October 9â€“12 New York NY, USA.
- The second model uses code originally developed by Paul Kellett as part of the [mda-vst project](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/) (see also https://github.com/topics/mda-plugins). Although the MDA Leslie effect was not a true Leslie speaker emulation, it works nicely in conjunction with the more realistic *setBfree* version.
- The plug-in includes a simple mixer to set the levels of the direct (unprocessed) signal and of the two separate Leslie effects.

## Graphical User Interface

The **MOrgan Cab** GUI is shown above. It consists of three *mix knobs* and a pop-up menu from which you may select how the simulated Leslie speed is switched from slow to fast.

#### Mix knobs

- **Direct Mix** controls the amount of the unprocessed input ("direct") signal appears in the output.
- **Leslie1 Mix** controls the amount from the output of the first Leslie model (from [setBfree project](https://setbfree.org/)).
- **Leslie2 Mix** controls the amount from the output of the second Leslie model (from  [mda-vst project](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/)).

All three knobs are calibrated in dB, in the range -48 dB to +12 dB, where -48 is effectively "minus infinity", i.e., no signal (designated "OFF" in the GUI) Note there will be no output (silence) f all three mix knobs are turned all the way counterclockwise to the "off" position.

The text which appears below each knob automatically changes from the knob's *label text* to the *current value of the corresponding parameter* while the mouse is positioned over the knob. You can *double-click the text* to enter a numeric value.

- There is no need to enter the trailing "dB" unit; it will be ignored if present.
- Press the Enter (Return) key on the computer keyboard to confirm the change.
- The value you enter will be clipped to the valid range -48 to +12.

Each knob also has a designated *default value*, which for all three mix knobs is -9.75 dB (equivalent to linear scaling value of one-third).

- All parameters are initialized to their default values when you first instantiate the plug-in.
- Double-clicking any knob reverts the parameter to its default value.

#### Leslie speed menu

The two Leslie emulations are configured to switch between "slow" and "fast" rotation speed, with "slow" being the default. The *Leslie speed menu* offers two choices for how the speed is changed:

1. **Mod Wheel**: the speed will switch to "fast" when a MIDI CC#1 (mod wheel) value greater than 63 is received, and return to "slow" when a value less than 64 is received. This is the default.
2. **Sustain Pedal**: the speed will switch to "fast" when a MIDI CC#64 (sustain pedal) value greater than 63 is received, and return to "slow" when a value less than 64 is received.

## Automation parameters

The **MOrgan Cab** plug-in exposes the three mix-level parameters for host automation. The parameter names are the same as the corresponding knob label text as follows:

- **Direct Mix** controls the amount of the unprocessed input ("direct") signal appears in the output.
- **Leslie1 Mix** controls the amount from the output of the first Leslie model.
- **Leslie2 Mix** controls the amount from the output of the second Leslie model.
